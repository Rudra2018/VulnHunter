## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **For Maximum Success:**

1. **Start Conservative** → Use default 5/7 layers
2. **Manually Verify** → Test PoCs before submitting
3. **Quality > Quantity** → Submit verified findings only
4. **Track Results** → Learn from acceptances/rejections
5. **Be Professional** → Clear reports, fast responses

### **Target These First:**
- Authentication libraries (JWT, OAuth)
- Serialization packages (pickle, YAML)
- ORM query builders
- Template engines
- File upload handlers

### **Platforms to Submit:**
- huntr.dev (primary)
- HackerOne
- Bugcrowd
- GitHub Security Lab
- Direct to maintainers

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **"No vulnerabilities found"**
→ System is working correctly! Zero-FP engine is conservative.
→ Try: Adjust to balanced mode (4/7 layers, 90% confidence)
→ Or: Scan more repositories

### **"Too many false positives"**
→ Switch to conservative mode (5/7 layers, 95% confidence)
→ Manually verify each finding

### **"Want more detections"**
→ Switch to aggressive mode (4/7 layers, 85% confidence)
→ Accept some false positives for learning
