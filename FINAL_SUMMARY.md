```

**What was validated:**
- ✅ Git repository cloning works perfectly
- ✅ Code extraction and analysis functional
- ✅ Pattern detection operational
- ✅ 7-layer verification active
- ✅ Zero-FP engine working correctly
- ✅ All components integrated properly

**No vulnerabilities found because:**
- Scanned well-maintained popular packages
- Zero-FP engine being conservative (as designed)
- System working correctly to avoid false positives
