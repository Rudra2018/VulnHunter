## Response to Reviewer A

### Comment A1: Reproducibility Concerns
> "The paper claims comprehensive reproducibility but the dataset collection process seems complex. How can reviewers verify the results without access to proprietary datasets?"

**Response:**
We appreciate this important concern about reproducibility. We have significantly enhanced our reproducibility package to address this issue:

1. **Complete Docker Environment**: We provide a fully containerized environment that includes all dependencies with exact version pinning (see `Dockerfile` and `requirements-lock.txt`).

2. **Minimal Verification Dataset**: We include a curated dataset (`data/minimal_dataset.csv`) with 15 representative vulnerability examples that demonstrates core functionality without requiring large-scale data collection.

3. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Our framework includes comprehensive synthetic data generation capabilities that can reproduce the key experimental results without requiring access to proprietary datasets.

4. **Smoke Tests**: We provide automated verification scripts (`smoke_test.py`) that validate the framework functionality in under 5 minutes, requiring no external data collection.

5. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: The `REPRODUCIBILITY_PACKAGE.md` document provides three levels of reproduction:
   - **Minimal (5 minutes)**: Core functionality verification
   - **Standard (1 hour)**: Representative results on synthetic data
   - **Complete (2-4 hours)**: Full reproduction with data collection

**Changes Made:**
- Added complete Docker environment with health checks
- Created minimal verification dataset with representative examples
- Enhanced documentation with multiple reproduction paths
- Implemented automated smoke tests for quick validation

### Comment A2: Dataset Bias and Generalizability
> "The evaluation focuses heavily on popular open-source projects. How does this generalize to proprietary enterprise codebases or different programming paradigms?"

**Response:**
This is an excellent point about generalizability. We acknowledge this limitation and have taken several steps to address it:

1. **Diverse Language Coverage**: Our evaluation includes 5 different programming languages (C/C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Go) representing different paradigms:
   - Systems programming (C/C++)
   - Object-oriented (Java)
   - Dynamic languages (Python, JavaScript)
   - Modern compiled languages (Go)

2. **Enterprise Validation**: We included one enterprise application (5.2M LOC) in our real-world validation, which showed comparable performance (84.3% accuracy) to open-source projects.

3. **Vulnerability Type Diversity**: Our evaluation covers 30 vulnerability types across different security domains, not just specific to open-source patterns.

4. **Theoretical Foundations**: The mathematical framework (Section 3) is language-agnostic and applies to any codebase that can be analyzed through abstract interpretation.

5. **Limitation Discussion**: We have added a dedicated section (7.3) discussing generalizability limitations and mitigation strategies.

**Limitations Acknowledged:**
- Proprietary codebases may have different coding patterns
- Functional programming languages require additional adaptation
- Domain-specific languages need specialized analysis

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Framework designed for extensibility to new languages
- Abstract mathematical foundations are paradigm-independent
- Transfer learning capabilities for adaptation to new domains

**Changes Made:**
- Added Section 7.3 on generalizability limitations
- Enhanced discussion of multi-paradigm validation
- Included recommendations for enterprise adaptation

### Comment A3: Statistical Significance Claims
> "While the paper claims statistical significance, the specific tests used and their assumptions should be more clearly documented."

**Response:**
We agree that statistical rigor is crucial for publication credibility. We have enhanced our statistical validation as follows:

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**: We employ multiple statistical tests to ensure robust validation:
   - **McNemar's Test**: For paired comparison of binary classifiers (χ² = 156.7, p < 0.001)
   - **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI with 10,000 iterations
   - **Effect Size Analysis**: Cohen's d = 2.34 (large effect)
   - **Bonferroni Correction**: Multiple testing correction applied

2. **Test Assumptions Validated**:
   - **Independence**: Samples drawn from different projects/codebases
   - **Sample Size**: >50,000 samples exceeds minimum requirements
   - **Distribution**: Non-parametric tests used where appropriate

3. **Detailed Statistical Analysis**: We provide complete statistical analysis code (`evaluation/statistical_analysis.py`) with:
   - Power analysis calculations
   - Assumption checking procedures
   - Sensitivity analysis for key parameters

**Changes Made:**
- Added detailed statistical methodology in Section 4.2.3
- Included effect size calculations and interpretations
- Enhanced Appendix with complete statistical analysis
- Provided statistical analysis code for reproduction

## Response to Reviewer C

### Comment C1: Novel Contributions vs Prior Work
> "The paper claims to be the first to unify formal methods and ML, but there have been previous attempts. The novelty should be more clearly articulated."

**Response:**
We appreciate this opportunity to clarify our novel contributions more precisely:

1. **Mathematical Rigor**: While previous works have *combined* formal methods and ML, ours is the first to provide a *mathematically rigorous unification* with:
   - Formal soundness and completeness proofs
   - Information-theoretic bounds connecting formal properties to neural representations
   - Unified lattice-theoretic framework spanning both domains

2. **LLM Integration**: No prior work has integrated Large Language Models for security reasoning at this scale:
   - Security-specific prompt engineering techniques
   - Confidence calibration across formal, ML, and LLM modalities
   - Explainable security analysis with natural language reasoning

3. **Provable Guarantees**: Unlike heuristic combinations, our framework provides:
   - Formal soundness guarantees (no false negatives from formal component)
   - Completeness bounds under specified conditions
   - Statistical learning theory connections to generalization bounds

4. **Comprehensive Validation**: Our empirical evaluation exceeds prior work in:
   - Scale: 50,000+ samples (vs. typical 5,000 in literature)
   - Statistical rigor: Multiple significance tests with effect size analysis
   - Real-world validation: 12.35M lines of production code

**Prior Work Distinctions:**
- **Facebook Infer**: Uses separation logic but no ML integration

This is an excellent security concern that we address through defense-in-depth:

1. **Threat Model Definition**:
   - **Trusted Components**: Framework core, mathematical analysis, ML models
   - **Untrusted Inputs**: Source code under analysis, external tool outputs
   - **Threat Actors**: Malicious code injection, resource exhaustion, data exfiltration
