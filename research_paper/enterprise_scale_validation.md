## Performance Scaling Analysis

### Computational Complexity

**Time Complexity:**
```
Empirical Analysis:
T(n) = 0.042n + 1,847 seconds

Where n = lines of code in thousands
R² = 0.97 (strong linear correlation)

Theoretical Analysis:
├── Static Analysis: O(n log n)
├── Dynamic Analysis: O(n)
├── ML Inference: O(n)
└── Overall: O(n log n)
```

**Memory Complexity:**
```
Empirical Analysis:
M(n) = 0.34n + 512 MB

Where n = lines of code in thousands
R² = 0.94 (strong linear correlation)

Peak memory usage scales sub-linearly due to:
├── Streaming analysis for large files
├── Garbage collection optimization
├── Intermediate result caching
└── Memory-mapped file processing
```
