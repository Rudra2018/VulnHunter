  "abstract": "We present VulnHunter \u03a9mega + VHS, the first application of Vulnerability Homotopy Space (VHS) to cybersecurity, achieving unprecedented precision in vulnerability detection through mathematical topology. Our framework combines eight mathematical primitives (\u03a9-primitives) with topological classification to distinguish real vulnerabilities from false positives using pure mathematical invariants rather than brittle heuristics. Experimental validation on the MegaVul dataset (15,026 samples) demonstrates perfect vulnerability detection (F1=1.0000) with 89.32% VHS classification accuracy. Real-world evaluation on BNB Chain smart contracts shows a 79\u00d7 precision improvement (0.7% \u2192 55.4%) and 55% false positive reduction.",
