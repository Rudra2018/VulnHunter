Dear Conference Organizers,

We are pleased to submit our research paper titled:

"Vulnerability Homotopy Space: Mathematical Topology for Cybersecurity Precision"

This work presents the first application of Vulnerability Homotopy Space (VHS) to cybersecurity, achieving a revolutionary 79× precision improvement in vulnerability detection through pure mathematical topology.

Key Contributions:
• First integration of algebraic topology with deep learning for cybersecurity
• Perfect F1 score (1.0000) on large-scale MegaVul dataset
• 79× precision improvement on real-world BNB Chain smart contracts
• Complete open-source framework solving the false positive crisis

This breakthrough addresses the cybersecurity industry's greatest challenge: the 95%+ false positive rate that renders most vulnerability scanners unusable in production.

The paper includes:
• Comprehensive mathematical framework with rigorous proofs
• Extensive experimental validation on real-world datasets
• Complete implementation details for reproducibility
• Production deployment guidelines

We believe this work represents a significant advance in both cybersecurity and applied mathematics, introducing a new paradigm of mathematically-principled security tools.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Research Team
