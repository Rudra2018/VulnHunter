# VulnHunter Neural-Formal Verification (NFV) Implementation

## 🎯 Achievement: World's First Neural-Formal Verification for Smart Contracts

VulnHunter v0.4 introduces the groundbreaking **Neural-Formal Verification (NFV) Layer** - the first system to combine neural vulnerability prediction with formal mathematical proofs using Z3 SMT solving.

## 🚀 Key Innovation

**Traditional tools predict, NFV proves.**

- **Slither**: Static rules → limited coverage
- **Mythril**: Symbolic execution → slow, no learning
- **VulnHunter NFV**: AI + Math → provable, fast, adaptive

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundation

### Neural-Formal Verification Equation
```
Total_Loss = λ₁ × Neural_Loss + λ₂ × Proof_Loss + λ₃ × Path_Loss
```

Where:
- **Neural_Loss**: GNN + Transformer prediction loss
- **Proof_Loss**: SMT satisfiability alignment loss
- **Path_Loss**: Attention-guided path selection loss

### Core Components

1. **Neural Hypothesis Generation**
   ```
   ĥ = σ(W_f [h_g ; h_t])
   ```
   - `h_g`: Graph Neural Network embedding
   - `h_t`: Transformer token embedding

2. **Symbolic Path Extraction**
   ```
   RiskScore(p) = Σ_{e∈p} A_e
   ```
   - Uses GNN attention weights to select risky execution paths

3. **Differentiable Constraint Generation**
   - Maps code constructs to Z3 expressions
   - Enables backpropagation through formal verification

4. **SMT Proof Engine**
   ```
   SAT(φ(p) ∧ exploit_template)
   ```
   - Generates formal proofs of vulnerability
   - Returns concrete exploit witnesses
