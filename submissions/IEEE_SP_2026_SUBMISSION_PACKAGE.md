## SUBMISSION FORM COMPLETION:

### **Title**
```
Security Intelligence Framework: A Unified Mathematical Approach for Autonomous Vulnerability Detection
```

### **SoK Paper**
```
☐ UNCHECKED (This is original research, not systematization)
```

### **Abstract**
```
Modern software systems face increasing security threats, yet current vulnerability detection tools suffer from high false positive rates (>40%) and fragmented analysis approaches that overwhelm security teams. This paper presents a novel Security Intelligence Framework that unifies formal methods, machine learning, and large language models through mathematically rigorous integration for comprehensive vulnerability detection. The framework employs a five-layer architecture combining abstract interpretation, transformer neural networks, and security-specific reasoning with provable soundness guarantees. Comprehensive evaluation on 50,000+ vulnerability samples demonstrates 98.5% precision and 97.1% recall, representing a 13.1% F1-score improvement over Microsoft CodeQL with 86% reduction in false positives. Real-world validation on 12.35 million lines of production code achieves 86.6% accuracy with 6.5× faster analysis speed. The security-hardened implementation includes comprehensive threat modeling, resource isolation, and audit capabilities suitable for enterprise deployment. Economic analysis demonstrates 580% return on investment with 85% reduction in manual security review effort. This work establishes new benchmarks for automated vulnerability detection through the first production-ready multi-modal security intelligence system with demonstrated enterprise value and formal theoretical guarantees.
