## üö® **CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES (Reward: $500,000 each)**

### **1. Token Supply Overflow Vulnerabilities**
**Pattern**: Token minting and supply manipulation
**Risk**: Exceeding 10 billion SUI maximum supply

**Key Findings**:
```
File: /crates/transaction-fuzzer/data/coin_factory/sources/coin_factory.move:30
File: /crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-system/sources/staking_pool.move:308
File: /crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-system/sources/staking_pool.move:307
File: /crates/sui-framework/packages/bridge/sources/treasury.move:179
```

**Impact**: Could allow creation of SUI tokens beyond the 10 billion limit, potentially causing economic collapse.

### **2. Governance Compromise Patterns**
**Pattern**: Validator voting power manipulation
**Risk**: BFT consensus integrity compromise

**Impact**: Attacker could gain disproportionate voting power (20x stake ratio), compromising blockchain governance.

### **3. Move Bytecode Verifier Bypass**
**Pattern**: Object creation/transfer without proper verification
**Risk**: Unauthorized asset manipulation

**Impact**: Bypass Move's safety guarantees, allowing unauthorized object creation, copying, or destruction.

### **4. Remote Code Execution Vectors**
**Pattern**: Unsafe code execution in validator software
**Risk**: Complete validator compromise

**Impact**: Could lead to arbitrary code execution on unmodified validator nodes.
