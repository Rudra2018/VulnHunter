# 🔥 SLIDE 2: THE SECURITY CRISIS WE'RE FACING
## Current State: Traditional SAST is Broken

### The Numbers Don't Lie:
- **92%** of enterprises struggle with false positives from SAST tools
- **$4.45M** average cost of a data breach in 2023
- **68%** of security teams spend more time chasing false alarms than real threats
- **23,000+** new CVEs published in 2023 alone

### The Problem Landscape:
```
Traditional SAST Tools → High False Positives → Alert Fatigue → Missed Real Threats
Manual Code Review → Slow & Inconsistent → Human Error → Critical Vulnerabilities Slip Through
Signature-Based Detection → Static Rules → Zero-Day Blindness → Advanced Attacks Succeed
```

## Q&A Preparation:

### Anticipated Questions & Responses:

**Q: How does this compare to GitHub's CodeQL or Semgrep?**
A: While CodeQL and Semgrep are excellent rule-based tools, Beast Mode uses machine learning trained on real vulnerability data from government and industry sources. This allows us to detect novel attack patterns that haven't been explicitly coded into rules.

**Q: What about false positives? How do you ensure accuracy?**
A: Our 12.5% false positive rate is achieved through ensemble learning and training on verified CVE data. Each prediction includes confidence scoring, allowing teams to prioritize high-confidence findings first.

**Q: Can this detect zero-day vulnerabilities?**
A: Our models learn patterns from known vulnerabilities and can identify similar patterns in new code, potentially catching zero-day style vulnerabilities. However, true zero-day detection remains an active area of research.

**Q: What's the licensing model for enterprise use?**
A: We're developing both open-source core components and enterprise licensing tiers. Early adopters can join our pilot program for preferential pricing and feature access.

**Q: How do you handle different programming languages and frameworks?**
A: Our feature engineering pipeline includes language-agnostic patterns and language-specific analyzers. We currently support 20+ languages with plans to expand based on community needs.

**Q: What about compliance with SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.?**
A: Enterprise deployments include compliance reporting features, audit logging, and can be deployed entirely on-premise for organizations with strict data requirements.
