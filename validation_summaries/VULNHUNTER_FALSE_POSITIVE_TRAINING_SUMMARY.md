## Training Data Summary

### Case Study: OpenAI Codex Fabricated Analysis Validation
- **Analysis Date**: October 13, 2025
- **Target Repository**: `/Users/ankitthakur/codex` (Anthropic Claude Code)
- **Fabricated Report Source**: `/Users/ankitthakur/Downloads/openai_codex_analysis/`
- **Validation Method**: Manual code inspection and cross-reference analysis

### Key False Positive Patterns Identified

#### 1. **Fabricated Memory Safety Violations**
- **Claims**: 49 critical unsafe operations (`transmute`, `std::ptr::write`, `slice::from_raw_parts`)
- **Reality**: Zero dangerous operations found
- **Detection Features**: Pattern existence validation, context analysis

#### 2. **Inflated Vulnerability Counts**
- **Claimed**: 2,553 dangerous `.unwrap()` calls
- **Actual**: 811 total `.unwrap()` calls (mostly in tests)
- **Detection Features**: Statistical anomaly detection

#### 3. **Fabricated API Security Issues**
- **Claims**: Hardcoded API keys like `const API_KEY: &str = "sk-..."`
- **Reality**: Only environment variables and test dummies
- **Detection Features**: Pattern matching, credential validation

#### 4. **Invalid File References**
- **Claims**: Vulnerabilities at specific lines (rmcp_client.rs:596)
- **Reality**: File only has 332 lines
- **Detection Features**: Line number validation
