## 🔍 Dual Validation Case Studies

### Case Study 1: OpenAI Codex (Complete Fabrication)
**Status**: COMPLETE_FABRICATION
**Detection Probability**: 96.6%
**Recommendation**: REJECT - Analysis contains fabricated claims

**Pattern Characteristics**:
- ❌ Fabricated code examples that don't exist in actual repositories
- ❌ Impossible line number references (beyond file lengths)
- ❌ Wrong repository analysis (claimed OpenAI, analyzed Anthropic)
- ❌ Dangerous code patterns not found in actual codebase
- ❌ Inflated vulnerability counts (3x actual patterns found)

### Case Study 2: Microsoft Bounty (Overly Optimistic)
**Status**: OVERLY_OPTIMISTIC
**Detection Probability**: 100%
**Recommendation**: USE WITH HEAVY DISCOUNTING - Unrealistic projections

**Pattern Characteristics**:
- ⚠️ Accurate bounty program information but unrealistic volume claims
- ⚠️ Artificial confidence generation (100% unique values - programmatic)
- ⚠️ Market value inflation (1.9x Microsoft's entire 2024 budget)
- ⚠️ Zero methodological diversity (claimed single ML method for all findings)
- ⚠️ Unrealistic discovery rate (1.9x major industry event submissions)
