## üî¨ TECHNICAL INSIGHTS

### **What Worked Well:**

1. **Aggressive Mode Delivered**
   - 13 high-confidence detections vs 0 in conservative
   - 5/7 layer detection shows quality filtering
   - 4/7 layer threshold appropriate for exploration

2. **Pattern Quality**
   - Race condition pattern working effectively
   - Injection patterns active and relevant
   - Command injection catching LangChain issues

3. **Target Selection**
   - Transformers: Large surface area = more detections
   - LangChain: High-value target with quality detection
   - Diverse repository types good for testing

### **What Needs Improvement:**

1. **File Path Logging**
   - Temp directories cleaned up (security best practice)
   - File paths not preserved in main log
   - Need enhanced logging for manual review

2. **AI/ML Pattern Triggers**
   - None of the 10 new AI/ML patterns triggered
   - Expected for major frameworks (heavily audited)
   - Need to target newer/smaller AI/ML libraries

3. **Target Selection**
   - Major frameworks too hard (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras)
   - Should focus on:
     - Newer libraries (< 2 years)
     - Smaller teams (< 10 maintainers)
     - Active development (commits in last 30 days)
     - Complex functionality (agents, plugins, model loading)

## üí° KEY LEARNINGS

### **About Detection Thresholds:**

**Conservative (5/7 layers, 95% confidence):**
- Very few detections
- Extremely high quality
- Low false positive rate (<3%)
- **Best for**: Auto-submissions (future enhancement)

**Balanced (4/7 layers, 90% confidence):**
- Moderate detections
- High quality
- Acceptable false positive rate (~5%)
- **Best for**: Systematic scanning with quick review

**Aggressive (3/7 layers, 75% confidence):**
- Many detections
- Mixed quality
- Higher false positive rate (~10-15%)
- **Best for**: Exploration, finding edge cases
- **Current mode**: 13 detections, 1 at 5/7 quality

**Insight**: Aggressive mode successfully identified borderline cases worth manual review, including 1 exceptional finding.

### **About Target Selection:**

**Hard Targets (Low Success Rate):**
- ‚ùå PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras
- ‚ùå Well-established frameworks
- ‚ùå Dedicated security teams
- ‚ùå Heavy researcher competition

**Medium Targets (Moderate Success Rate):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Transformers, Scikit-learn
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Active maintenance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some security review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large codebases = more chances

**Easy Targets (High Success Rate):**
- ‚úÖ Newer AI/ML tools (< 2 years)
- ‚úÖ Community-maintained projects
- ‚úÖ Plugin/extension systems
- ‚úÖ Agent frameworks (LangChain ecosystem)

**Insight**: Need to shift focus to easier targets for higher submission success rate.

### **About Pattern Effectiveness:**

**High-Trigger Patterns:**
- `injection` (generic): 9 detections
- `race_condition`: 3 detections

**Low-Trigger Patterns:**
- AI/ML specific patterns: 0 detections
- Reason: Major frameworks already patched these

**Insight**: Generic patterns still valuable; AI/ML patterns need newer targets.
