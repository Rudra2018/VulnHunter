## 🎯 WHY THESE TARGETS ARE BETTER

### **Vs. Previous Targets (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras)**

**Previous Scan**:
- ❌ Major frameworks = heavily audited
- ❌ Large security teams
- ❌ Well-known patterns already patched
- ❌ High competition from expert researchers

**This Scan**:
- ✅ Newer libraries (< 2 years old)
- ✅ Smaller teams (< 20 developers)
- ✅ Active development = rapid changes
- ✅ Less security review
- ✅ Higher attack surface (plugins, APIs, agents)

### **Expected Success Rate**

**Previous Scan**:
- Major frameworks: 0-2% real vulnerability rate
- Found: 1 verified (race condition in Transformers)
- Success: Took 208 files to find 1

**This Scan**:
- Newer libraries: 5-15% real vulnerability rate
- Expected: 3-8 verified vulnerabilities
- Success: Higher quality per file scanned

## 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### **High-Value Patterns**

**CRITICAL Severity (CVSS 9.0+)**:
1. Command injection in agent frameworks
2. Deserialization in API layers
3. Code execution in eval/exec usage
4. Buffer overflows in C++ code

**HIGH Severity (CVSS 7.0-8.9)**:
1. SSRF in proxy/routing logic
2. SQL/NoSQL injection in vector DBs
3. Path traversal in file operations
4. Authentication bypasses

**MEDIUM Severity (CVSS 5.0-6.9)**:
1. Race conditions in state management
2. Information disclosure
3. DoS vulnerabilities

## 📊 SCAN PROGRESS TRACKING

Monitor progress:
```bash
# Watch live progress
tail -f better_targets_scan.log

# Count high-confidence detections
grep "4/7\|5/7 layers passed" better_targets_scan.log | wc -l

# Check verified vulnerabilities
grep "VERIFIED" better_targets_scan.log

# View scan status
ps aux | grep better_targets_scanner
```

---

## ⏱️ ESTIMATED TIMELINE

**Per Repository**: 2-5 minutes
- Clone: 30-60 seconds
- Analyze 30 files: 1-3 minutes
- Cleanup: 10 seconds

**Total Scan Time**: 20-50 minutes
**Expected Completion**: ~30 minutes from start

---

## 🎯 AFTER SCAN COMPLETES

### **Immediate Analysis** (30 minutes)

1. **Review high-confidence detections**
   ```bash
   grep -B 10 "5/7 layers passed" better_targets_scan.log > priority_findings.txt
   grep -B 10 "4/7 layers passed" better_targets_scan.log > secondary_findings.txt
   ```

2. **Count by repository**
   ```bash
   for repo in litellm vllm guidance langserve langgraph autogpt agentgpt chroma weaviate llama.cpp; do
     count=$(grep "$repo" better_targets_scan.log | grep "VERIFIED" | wc -l)
     echo "$repo: $count verified"
   done
   ```

3. **Prioritize manual review**
   - Focus on 5/7 layer detections first
   - Then review 4/7 in CRITICAL repositories
   - Target CRITICAL severity patterns

### **Manual Verification** (2-4 hours)

For each high-confidence detection:
1. Clone repository
2. Find exact file and line
3. Analyze vulnerability
4. Create PoC if exploitable
5. Write report

### **Submission** (1-2 days)

1. Verify top 3-5 findings
2. Create professional reports
3. Submit to huntr.com + maintainers
4. Track responses
