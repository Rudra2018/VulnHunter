Of course! This is a fantastic area to get into. The availability of large, high-quality datasets of code and smart contracts has grown significantly, driven by the AI/ML and blockchain security communities.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of datasets, categorized by their primary use case.

1. General Purpose Code Datasets (Great for Pre-training)

These datasets contain code from multiple languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++, JavaScript) and are ideal for training foundational code models that can be later fine-tuned for specific tasks.

The Stack & Stack v2 (from BigCode):

What it is: A massive, permissively licensed dataset sourced from public GitHub repositories. It's the go-to dataset for training large language models for code (Code LLMs). It includes deduplicated code across hundreds of programming languages.
Size: Several terabytes of code.

CodeParrot (from Hugging Face):

What it is: A predecessor to The Stack, but still a well-known and curated dataset of Python code from GitHub.

Google's BigQuery Public Datasets:

What it is: You can query a massive snapshot of GitHub activity directly using SQL. This gives you immense flexibility to create your own custom dataset based on stars, commit history, languages, etc.
Link: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data (look for the bigquery-public-data.github_repos dataset)
CodeNet (from IBM):

What it is: A large dataset focused on code translation and performance analysis. It contains ~14 million code samples in 55+ languages, all solving around 4,000 problems on online judges.
Use Case: Great for tasks like code translation (e.g., Python to Java) and code similarity.

2. Specialized Smart Contract Datasets

These are specifically for the blockchain domain and are often labeled for tasks like vulnerability detection, compiler classification, or decompilation.

A. Raw Source Code (Solidity)

Smart Contract Sanctuary:

What it is: A curated collection of verified Solidity source code from Ethereum Mainnet and various testnets. It's organized by address and is perfect for getting real-world, deployable contracts.

Etherscan Verified Contracts:

What it is: You can scrape or use the Etherscan API to download the source code of verified contracts. This is the "raw material" for many other curated datasets.
Note: Be mindful of their terms of service if you plan to scrape.
B. Labeled Vulnerability Datasets (Most Valuable for Security)

These are the gold standard for training and benchmarking vulnerability detection models.

SmartBugs Dataset:

What it is: A curated collection of ~47K Solidity files annotated with vulnerabilities (like Reentrancy, Integer Overflow) using a variety of static analysis tools. It's one of the most widely used benchmarks.
Link: https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs (The dataset is in the dataset directory)
SolidiFI:

What it is: A framework for injecting vulnerabilities into Solidity code. The dataset contains both buggy and fixed versions of contracts, which is perfect for tasks like bug detection and repair.
Link: https://github.com/SoheilKh/SolidiFI-benchmark
DeFiHackLabs:

What it is: A collection of real-world post-mortem analyses and exploit code from DeFi hacks. This is excellent for studying real attack vectors.

DASP Top 10:

What it is: While not a dataset per se, the "Damn Vulnerable DeFi" challenges and the "Ethernaut" CTF provide a set of contracts with known vulnerabilities, which can be used as a small, high-quality training set.

C. Bytecode & Runtime Data

Ethereum ETL:

What it is: A project that transforms the raw Ethereum blockchain data into accessible formats like CSV and JSON stored in Google BigQuery. You can get contract bytecode, transaction traces, and logs here.
Use Case: Training models on bytecode or analyzing transaction patterns.
