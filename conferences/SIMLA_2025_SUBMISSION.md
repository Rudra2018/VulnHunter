## Manuscript Adaptation Strategy

### Title (Conference Version)
"Secure Multi-Modal Machine Learning for Vulnerability Detection: Formal Guarantees and Enterprise Deployment"

### Abstract Adaptation (Focus on ML Security)
Machine learning models for vulnerability detection face critical security challenges including adversarial attacks, model poisoning, and lack of formal guarantees. This paper presents a security-hardened multi-modal framework that integrates formal verification with machine learning for enterprise vulnerability detection. Our approach provides mathematical guarantees against common ML attacks while achieving 98.5% precision on 50,000+ vulnerability samples. The framework includes: (1) adversarial-robust neural networks with formal verification bounds, (2) secure model training with differential privacy, (3) runtime integrity verification for ML predictions, and (4) comprehensive threat modeling for ML-based security systems. Real-world deployment on 12.35 million lines of production code demonstrates both security robustness and superior detection performance, establishing new standards for trustworthy ML in cybersecurity applications.
