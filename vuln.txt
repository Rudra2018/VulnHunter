Mission Objective
Perform a comprehensive cleanup of the VulnHunter repository by removing old, legacy, and unnecessary files both locally and on GitHub. Prepare the repository for the new enhanced v2.0 restructuring and model integration.

Key Tasks
1. Backup Existing State

Create a backup branch with the current repository state for safety and rollback.

Push the backup branch to GitHub.

2. Analyze Current Repository

Inventory existing files and directory structure.

Identify critical files to keep (LICENSE, .gitignore, requirements.txt, setup.py, ML models, configs).

Identify legacy/outdated files and directories to remove.

3. Local Cleanup

Remove all temporary, cache, and IDE-specific files (e.g., *.pyc, __pycache__, .vscode/, .idea/).

Delete old Python scripts, legacy modules, and outdated documentation.

Clean old configuration files and test files unrelated to the new structure.

4. Git Repository Clean-Up

Remove deleted files from git tracking (git add -u).

Clean untracked files and ignored files (git clean).

Commit the cleanup changes with a descriptive commit message.

5. GitHub Synchronization

Push cleanup commits to the remote repository.

Validate cleanup on GitHub repository.

Optionally, manually clean old releases and issues on GitHub.

6. Verification and Final Checks

Confirm repository is free of legacy files and clean.

Validate Python syntax of remaining files.

Confirm requirements and dependencies are intact.

Tag this cleanup as a milestone for future reference.

Safety Instructions
Never delete .git/ directory.

Preserve essential files and folders.

Ensure backup branch exists before any deletions.

Log all cleanup operations for audit.

bash
# Backup current state
git checkout -b backup/pre-v2-cleanup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
git push origin backup/pre-v2-cleanup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
git checkout main

# Remove unwanted files locally
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
find . -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +
rm -rf .vscode .idea
