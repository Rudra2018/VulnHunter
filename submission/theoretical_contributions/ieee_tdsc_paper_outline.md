## ABSTRACT

This paper presents four novel theoretical frameworks addressing fundamental challenges in cybersecurity economics and vulnerability prediction. We introduce: (1) a game-theoretic model for multi-agent vulnerability markets with Nash equilibrium analysis, (2) information-theoretic bounds for security scoring using entropy measures, (3) quantum-inspired uncertainty quantification through superposition states, and (4) adversarial robustness certificates with Lipschitz guarantees. Our theoretical contributions provide mathematical foundations for vulnerability assessment while achieving practical improvements in bug bounty optimization.

**Keywords:** Game Theory, Information Theory, Quantum Computing, Adversarial Learning, Vulnerability Assessment

## 3. THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

### 3.1 Game-Theoretic Vulnerability Economics

**THEOREM 1: Nash Equilibrium Existence**
For vulnerability game G = (N, S, U):
- Nash equilibrium exists (finite players, compact convex strategies)
- Convergence guaranteed under contraction mapping
- Complexity: O(n³) for n-player games

**Mathematical Model:**
```
U_researcher(b,e,p) = b·p - C(e)
U_program(b,v,d) = v - b - d
U_attacker(e,r) = e - r
```

### 3.2 Information-Theoretic Security Scoring

**THEOREM 2: Vulnerability Entropy Bounds**
For vulnerability entropy H(V):
- H(V) = -∑ P(vᵢ) log P(vᵢ)
- Prediction error ≥ (H(Y) - I(X;Y) - 1) / log|Y| (Fano's inequality)
- Sample complexity: O(√(d log n / n))

### 3.3 Quantum-Inspired Uncertainty Quantification

**THEOREM 3: Quantum State Compression**
Quantum encoding provides exponential compression:
- Classical: n vulnerability states
- Quantum: 2^k basis states (k ≪ n)
- Von Neumann entropy: S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ)

### 3.4 Adversarial Robustness Certificates

**THEOREM 4: Lipschitz Robustness Bound**
For Lipschitz constant L:
- |f(x+δ) - f(x)| ≤ L·||δ||
- Certified bound: ε·L for perturbation ||δ|| ≤ ε
- Randomized smoothing provides probabilistic guarantees
