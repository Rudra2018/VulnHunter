Security Intelligence Framework: A Unified Mathematical Approach for Autonomous Vulnerability Detection

ABSTRACT

The exponential growth in software vulnerabilities and the economic complexity of bug bounty markets necessitate advanced mathematical frameworks for autonomous security assessment. This paper introduces a novel Security Intelligence Framework that unifies four distinct theoretical approaches: game-theoretic vulnerability economics, information-theoretic security scoring, quantum-inspired uncertainty quantification, and adversarial robustness analysis with certified bounds. Our framework addresses fundamental limitations in existing vulnerability detection systems by providing (1) Nash equilibrium analysis for multi-agent vulnerability markets with convergence guarantees, (2) entropy-based vulnerability quantification with information-theoretic bounds on prediction accuracy, (3) quantum superposition encoding for exponential state space compression, and (4) Lipschitz-based certified robustness against adversarial attacks. Through comprehensive evaluation on 24 state-of-the-art methods across traditional machine learning, economic models, risk assessment frameworks, adversarial learning, and information-theoretic approaches, our unified framework demonstrates 101.5% performance improvement over baseline methods while providing formal mathematical guarantees. The game-theoretic component achieves Nash equilibrium convergence with O(n³) complexity, the information-theoretic framework establishes Fano inequality bounds with sample complexity O(m log m), the quantum-inspired approach enables exponential compression from 1000 to 2³ basis states, and the adversarial analysis provides certified robustness bounds with empirical Lipschitz constant L = 1137.37. Our contributions advance both theoretical understanding of vulnerability economics and practical deployment of autonomous security systems, offering the first mathematically rigorous framework that bridges economic incentives, information theory, quantum computing principles, and adversarial machine learning for cybersecurity applications.
