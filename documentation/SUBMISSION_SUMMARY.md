Dear Dr. Rawat,

Thank you for your feedback on manuscript TDSC-2025-10-1683
"Security Intelligence Framework: A Unified Mathematical Approach
for Autonomous Vulnerability Detection."

I have reformatted the manuscript using the IEEE Computer Society
double-column template as requested. The updated submission complies
with all IEEE TDSC formatting requirements:

- Double-column, single-spaced layout (IEEEtran class)
- Proper section structure and formatting
- IEEE reference style
- 10pt font throughout

The manuscript content remains substantively unchanged from the
original submission.

Please let me know if any additional changes are required.

Best regards,
