   ```python
   with open(str(OUTPUT), 'w', encoding='utf-8-sig') as f_out:
   ```
   - Confidence: 99.99%
   - Risk: HIGH - Unvalidated file path usage

3. **Path Traversal** - `/tmp/azure_cli/scripts/_common.py:17`
   ```python
   while not os.path.exists(os.path.join(here, '.git')):
   ```
   - Confidence: 99.99%
   - Risk: HIGH - Directory traversal potential
