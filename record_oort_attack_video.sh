echo "   Say: 'This demonstrates a critical remote code execution vulnerability'"
echo "   Say: 'in the OORT blockchain P2P networking stack with CVSS 9.8'"
echo "   Show: Terminal with clear title"
echo

echo "2. VULNERABILITY EXPLANATION (0:30-1:30)"
echo "   Say: 'The vulnerability exists in mcp/p2p/peer.cpp at line 106'"
echo "   Say: 'It's a buffer overflow in boost::asio async_read operations'"

echo "   Say: 'This vulnerability allows complete remote node compromise'"
echo "   Say: 'An attacker could take control of entire OORT network nodes'"
echo "   Say: 'This could lead to fund theft and network disruption'"
echo "   Show: Highlight the successful exploitation message"
echo

echo "5. CONCLUSION (4:30-5:00)"
echo "   Say: 'This is a critical vulnerability requiring immediate patching'"
echo "   Say: 'The proof-of-concept demonstrates real exploitation potential'"
echo "   Say: 'Network operators should update immediately when patches are available'"
