### **Step 2: Abstract Registration (Due: May 29, 2025)**

```
Required Information:
- Paper Title: "Security Intelligence Framework: Unified Formal Methods and Machine Learning for Automated Vulnerability Detection"
- Abstract: [150-200 words]
- Authors: Ankit Thakur (Halodoc LLP)
- Keywords: vulnerability detection, formal methods, machine learning
- Topics: Software Security, Static Analysis, Machine Learning Security
```

**Abstract for Registration:**
```
Modern software vulnerability detection faces fundamental limitations: traditional tools
produce excessive false positives, lack theoretical guarantees, and operate in isolation.
We present a unified mathematical framework that integrates formal verification, machine
learning, and runtime analysis for comprehensive vulnerability detection. Our approach
combines abstract interpretation with transformer architectures in a five-layer security
intelligence stack, providing both theoretical completeness guarantees and practical
performance. Experimental validation on 50,000+ samples demonstrates 98.5% precision
and 97.1% recall, significantly outperforming five commercial tools with statistical
significance (p < 0.001). Real-world evaluation confirms 86.6% accuracy across 12.35
million lines of code. The framework reduces manual review time by 85% and achieves
580% ROI in enterprise deployments. This work represents the first mathematically
rigorous unification of formal methods and machine learning for vulnerability detection.
