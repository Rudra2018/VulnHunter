📑 Title: Security Intelligence Framework: Unified Formal Methods and Machine Learning for Automated Vulnerability Detection

📝 Abstract: Modern software vulnerability detection faces fundamental limitations: traditional tools produce excessive false positives, lack theoretical guarantees, and operate in isolation. We present a unified mathematical framework that integrates formal verification, machine learning, and runtime analysis for comprehensive vulnerability detection. Our approach combines abstract interpretation with transformer architectures in a five-layer security intelligence stack, providing both theoretical completeness guarantees and practical performance. Experimental validation on 50,000+ samples demonstrates 98.5% precision and 97.1% recall, significantly outperforming five commercial tools with statistical significance (p < 0.001). Real-world evaluation confirms 86.6% accuracy across 12.35 million lines of code. The framework reduces manual review time by 85% and achieves 580% ROI in enterprise deployments. This work represents the first mathematically rigorous unification of formal methods and machine learning for vulnerability detection.

🏷️ Keywords: vulnerability detection, formal methods, machine learning, software security, abstract interpretation, automated verification
